\label{chap:how-to-read}
This Master's Thesis takes a Storytelling approach while reporting the work done. The document is split into four major parts and is intended to be read in continuous as the previously mentioned notions are often required. To help the reader, we built a glossary, which we recommend to read as a preliminary work to not get overwhelmed. 

\section*{Project preface}
Here, we introduce the project at a high-level and the motivations we have towards it.

\section*{State-of-the-art}
In this part, we perform state-of-the-art research for Chatbots and Natural Language Processing using a Question-Answering.

\section*{Design and realization}
In this part, the reader follows us in our state-of-the-art analysis and our adventure at building our research contribution with a proof-of-concept.

\section*{Retrospective}
Finally, we review our academic journey by taking a step back and commenting on our work.
