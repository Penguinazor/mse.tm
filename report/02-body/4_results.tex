CPUs Specification

}

\section{Benchmarks}
\todo{
On ConvQuestions, we did a complete reevaluation of all alorithms for consistency. and the missing precision and recall metric.
GraphQA is very long to run, which resulted in this amount of results. But it's already a good pool of questions to evaluate from. It's clear that it would be better to evaluate on more data. 
Concerning the generated sentences evaluation we asked humans to do it, as we didn't have enough time to implement the google protocol. And the main focus of GraphQA is the ability of exploiting sub-graphs, and how transformers are performing at what they are designed to do.
