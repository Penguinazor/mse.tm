\section{Choice}
Based on the state of the art and the specifications, we decided to build evaluate our work with two qa datasets, SImpleQuestions and ConvQuestions. And compare our work with CONVEX, qAnswer, and Platypus. Converning Google's dataset, we whish we had more time to compare to, but instead we will evaluate the manually. To be exetnded in a future work.

\section{At the edge of technologies and sota}
we are only using techs release in late 2019 

\section{Tools}
Spacy is an impressive industry used multi tool framework that we used as it allows combine \gls{ner} \gls{nel} \gls{pos} \gls{pos-tag} .. We used the new 2019 released version 2

\section{Evaluation}
We will evaluate CONVEX on simplequestions as well, in addition to revaluating qAnswer and Platypus.

On ConvQuestions, we did a complete reevaluation of all alorithms for consistency. and the missing precision and recall metric.
